                  It's important to note that tooth bud extraction can have
                  serious and detrimental effects on oral health. The tooth buds
                  are the immature teeth that are still developing beneath the
                  gums in children. Removing these tooth buds interferes with
                  the natural eruption and alignment of permanent teeth, leading
                  to various dental issues.

                <p className="px-4 pb-4">
                  Some potential effects of tooth bud extraction include:
                  Misalignment of Teeth, Impacted Teeth, Bite Problems
                  ,Psychological Impact. It's essential to prioritize
                  evidence-based dental care practices.
